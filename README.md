# Another-DB-Gamemode

Drunks based Game Mode for Demon Bluff.
Press 'V' after opening a game in Endless mode.

This gamemode supposedly takes place inside a tavern, with 18 cards split into 3 groups of 6. (tables are #1 - #6, #7 - #12, #13 - #18).
I did not playtest this, and there is a TON of corruption-based stuff in this mode. Good luck.

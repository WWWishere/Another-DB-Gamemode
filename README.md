# Another-DB-Gamemode

Drunks based Game Mode for Demon Bluff.
Press 'V' after opening a game in Endless mode.

This gamemode supposedly takes place inside a tavern, with 18 cards split into 3 groups of 6. (tables are #1 - #6, #7 - #12, #13 - #18).
This mode is really hard. Good luck.

There are 2 special roles for this Game Mode.

Bartender - can corrupt nearby characters.

Tavernkeeper - can tell you how many characters are corrupt. 

* Currently using Baa's sprite (again) for Tavernkeeper. It's not evil, it's just a placeholder sprite
